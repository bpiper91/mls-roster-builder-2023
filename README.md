# MLS Roster Builder (2023)

## Description

This is a quick one-page interactive project to help visualize a Major League Soccer roster without needing to know all of the complicated roster rules.

The user inputs some team and player data, and the application assigns players to the senior or supplemental roster based on their various designations, alerting the user if they are out of compliance with the league's roster rules.
